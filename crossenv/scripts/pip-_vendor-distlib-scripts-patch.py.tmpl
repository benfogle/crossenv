    Build a shebang line. The default pip behavior will use a "simple" shim
    if the path to the wrapped Python binary is < 127 chars long, and doesn't
    contain a space. However, the host python binary isn't actually a binary -
    it's a shell script that does additional environment modifications - and
    os.execv() raises "OSError [Errno 8] Exec format error" if the shebang
    of a script isn't a literal binary.

    So - patch the script writer so that it *always* uses a shim.
